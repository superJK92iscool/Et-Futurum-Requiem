WARNING!

Though this project is licensed under the LGPL-3.0 a lot of the code featured here is a direct copy or adaptation of
Mojangs original code. So be careful with what you do with it.

This project is jss2a98aj's fork of KryptonCaptain's Et Futurum build, as well as a merge of my own (Roadhog460's)
changes I made to Et Futurum and never published anywhere. Thanks to other incredible notable contributors such as
makamys among various things, including helping setup mixins, contributed hugely useful changes like porting the
expanded container code for Iron Shulker Boxes, and CI + nomixin to the gradle and GitHub scripts. And embeddedt who
contributed some incredibly large-scale backports like the Backlytra port and spectator mode, the F3 gamemode switcher
and other really good contributions.

The mod uses MCLib's AssetDirector module to download assets from Mojang's servers.
Check [its wiki page](https://github.com/makamys/MCLib/wiki/AssetDirector) for more information.

## Dependencies

The mod requires [UniMixins](https://modrinth.com/mod/unimixins), more specifically, the GTNH module.

### About `nomixin` builds (Obsolete)

From versions 2.4.1 to 2.6.0, the mod came in two flavors:

* The regular version embeds Mixin 0.7.11, allowing the mod to run standalone. However, this makes the jar a bit larger,
  and can cause problems in certain use cases.
* The version marked with `nomixin` doesn't embed Mixin, which lets it avoid these problems. But it requires a
  separate [Mixin bootstrap mod](https://gist.github.com/makamys/7cb74cd71d93a4332d2891db2624e17c#mixin-bootstrap-mods)
  to be installed in order to run. If you have one installed already, getting this version is recommended.

From those versions, mixin code will also not work if you do not
add `--tweakClass org.spongepowered.asm.launch.MixinTweaker --mixin mixins.etfuturum.json` to your program arguments.
