	 * You don't need to add the interface if you do not wish to; Your IDE may falsely declare the function as unused however.
	 * If this function is not overridden by a BlockFalling, it will use the block's MapColor, with FF alpha added before it.

	 * @param meta The metadata of the block the dust is falling from.
	 * @return An ARGB color value, typically hex. EG 0xFFAA00FF for purple dust
